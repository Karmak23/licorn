=====================
Licorn® Documentation
=====================

Licorn® is a small-set of concise programs, aimed at GNU/Linux and Un*x system administrators, to help them deal with daily system-management tasks (managing users, groups, calendars, printers, backups, shares, and so on) in the most efficient manner possible

Don't you have ever faced this situation: "*don't get in my way, program, just do what I want and keep it simple, huh?*" . We did, and Licorn® is our answer on the system-management side of the story.

It is designed by long-standing GNU/Linux and \*BSD admins, and agile-implemented with the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming language, with flexibility and extensibility in mind.

As a beginning, I suggest you read the :ref:`installation process <install>`, then you'll be ready to :ref:`dive into the quickstarter <quickstart>` and enjoy the mystic-horse-powers of our beloved creation. Fasten your keyboard.

By the way, feel free to `contact us <mailto:dev@licorn.org>`_ to provide feedback or ask questions, we will be pleased to answer.
