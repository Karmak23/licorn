Licorn® CLI (Command Line Interface)
====================================

The Licorn® CLI consists of five tools, used to manage the entire system:

.. glossary::

	get
		list, select and display data
	
	add
		add objects to the system
	
	mod
		modify system objects
	
	del 
		delete objects from the system
	
	chk
		check objects, paths, configuration, whatever can be, and repair interactively (or not).

All of them include integrated help if you call the program with argument `--help` (or `-h`) or if you make any mistake on the command line.

The logic behind the CLI is convention-driven, oriented towards extreme simplicity and maximum automatism. All CLI tools will try to provide maximum flexibility to you. Understand that:

#. commands you type can be as small as possible, provided there is no ambiguity,
#. command-line flags are legions, but most of them are synonyms: *just pick the one that fits you best*,
