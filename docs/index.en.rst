Licorn® Documentation
=====================

.. warning:: Licorn documentation is undergoing a big refresh to include upcoming functionnalities. All should be OK for March 5th, 2012, but until then, the site contents are going to change a lot, and possibly be broken at some point.

Licorn® is a set of concise programs aimed at GNU/Linux and Un*x system administrators. They help them deal with daily system-management tasks (managing users, groups, calendars, printers, backups, shares, and so on) in the most efficient manner possible.

It is designed by long-standing GNU/Linux and \*BSD admins, and agile-implemented with the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming language, with flexibility and extensibility in mind.

As a beginning, I suggest you read the :ref:`installation process <install>`, then you'll be ready to :ref:`dive into the quickstarter <quickstart>` and enjoy the mystic-horse-powers of our beloved creation. Fasten your keyboard.

By the way, feel free to `contact us <mailto:dev@licorn.org>`_ to provide feedback or ask questions, we will be pleased to answer.
