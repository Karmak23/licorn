= Contrib API =

Contains API and tools modules :
 * which are roughly equivalent to CORE modules when talking about functiunalities, 
 * but not integrated into core for various reasons (not so clean, not well designed, and so on)
 * Contrib modules use foundations and CORE api when needed.
 
For example, today Contrib API modules are mainly classes and procedures called by Debian maintainer - python - scripts, like /usr/sbin/update-licorn-*.
