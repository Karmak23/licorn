# Experimental features (default: False)

# don't disable the INotifier unless you know exactly what you do, or a LicornÂ®
# developper asks you to do it. Else, all your shared files ACLs will go out of
# sync and you will need to run `chk` everytime any file/directory changes.

# Completely disable extensions at will (2 ways).
#
# In normal conditions, extension availability and activation are determined
# by the real presence of services and binaries on your system (and their
# status in /etc/default/*, or distro equivalent).
#
# But you could want to force one or more extension not to load (eg. extensions
# which are always enabled, or services you want to manage manually).
#
# The global directive (a python list):
#extensions.ignore = [ 'squid', 'rdiffbackup' ]
#
# or the individual settings:
#extensions.openssh.ignore = True
#extensions.volumes.ignore = True
#extensions.caldavd.ignore = True
#extensions.squid.ignore = True
#extensions.caldavd.ignore = True

# You can manually disable backends the same way (global or individual directive)
#backends.openldap.ignore = True
#backends.dnsmasq.ignore = True

# Just for testing. This should NOT work (shadow backend must always be enabled).
#backends.shadow.enabled = False
