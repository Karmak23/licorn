= Licorn® Contribs =

Code contained here is either:

	* not coming from licorn. Eg. :file:`apt_check.py` comes from :program:`update-notifier` but is slightly modified to fit in licorn, thus copied here.

	* not related to Licorn® at runtime. Eg. `dev_install.py` is an install script run by the `Makefile` target `devinstall`. See http://docs.licorn.org/ for details.

	* old code, or things I want to look at some day.

.. note:: **important**: `contrib` is *imported* in various places in Licorn®. Each file you put here should be syntaxically correct at least!!
