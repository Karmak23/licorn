Functionnalities
================

Trying to sum up Licorn速 features in a few words is a hard task: simply put, here at `META IT <http://meta-it.fr/>`_ we use Licorn速 to manage our GNU/Linux systems. Having said that, we can try to list some emerging points:


.. glossary::
	
	Users management
		* LDAP or Unix shadow account
			* :ref:`chk` enforces permissions and ACLs inside the home dir
		* Optional users attributes via :ref:`extensions`
			* individual calendar & delegations
			* mail addresses, aliases
			* personnal web folder
	
	Groups and data sharing
		* Unix or LDAP groups
		* Shares for member (via one special directory linked to all member's homes)
			* shares can be :ref:`grouperms permissive or not`
			* shares are inotified by daemon, permissions are live-enforced
			* ref:`chk` enforces permissions, checks symlink in member's homes and other sanitizations
		* optional attributes via extensions
	
	System profiles
		* can be seen as a group template
		* hold default quotas, skell, shell, groups memberships
		* are altered live (existing members get instant modifications), or not
	
	Machines
		* `machines` refer to computers, networked printers, scanners, routers, etc
		* automatically discovered at runtime from various sources (local lease files, local network scan, manual adds)
		* remote power off if supported (with a Licorn速 local install)
		* remote upgrades (can be interactive with GNU/Linux clients)
		* remote generic settings apply (env / gconf / KDE / win32)
	
	Printers
		* to be documented (CUPS support)
		
	Configuration and System
		* centralize and alter system-wide parameters and other daemons configuration (:program:`apache`, :program:`postfix`, :program:`dnsmasq`...)
		* enable or disable backends and extensions at runtime
		* remote execution and configuration
	
		
To extend this feature list, you can read the :ref:`implementation` section.
