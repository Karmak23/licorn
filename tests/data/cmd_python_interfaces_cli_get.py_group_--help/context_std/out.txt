                    warnings/errors.
    -v, --verbose   be more verbose (in command-line mode) ; you can get more
                    with -vv, -vvv, etc.[01;37mthe default is INFO level of
                    verbosity[0;0m, which is quite moderated. You will get
                    information about auto-generated passwords and long-time

                    flood your terminal).
